## EXPERIMENT2.b Design CMOS inverter and Perform DC and OP analysis.

## Aim: To Design CMOS inverter and Perform DC and OP analysis.

## Tools Used: 
Virtuoso Schematic Editor is used for the design and analysis.

## Theory:
CMOS inverter consists of a p-channel MOSFET(PMOS)and an n-channel MOSFET(NMOS)connectedinseriesbetweenthepowersupply(V_DD)andground.Whentheinputvoltage is low, the PMOS transistor turns ON, pulling the output to high (V_DD),while the NMOS is OFF. When the input is high, the NMOS turns ON, pulling the output to low (ground),and the PMOS turns OFF. This complementary action produces an output that is the logicalInversion of the input. CMOS inverter shave low static power consumption and high noise margins, making them ideal for digital logic circuits.
